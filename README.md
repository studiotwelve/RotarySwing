# RotarySwing
Serve rotaryswing.com from iOS app using a webview

### Punch List
- Get Apple iOS Developer Program Credentials
- Edit App Permissions [needs none]
- Get Signing Certificate and Convert [@see: http://docs.build.phonegap.com/en_US/signing_signing-ios.md.html]
- Resolve subscriber migration issue (do we build the migration interface? Needs to happen server side in php)
- Generate png files, App Icon(s) and Splash Screen(s) for all platforms, orientations and resolutions
- Suggest better mobile ui - there are pages that break the layout (look for word-break word-wrap css issues) [@see frontpage header]
